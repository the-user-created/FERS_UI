# FERS-UI Documentation

Welcome to the FERS-UI documentation. This set of documents aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the

Simulator's graphical user interface.

Whether you are a new contributor, a developer looking to extend the UI, or simply curious about its inner workings,
these pages will guide you through the key concepts that make FERS-UI a robust and user-friendly simulation workbench.
