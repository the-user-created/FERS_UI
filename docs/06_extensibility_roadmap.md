# 6. Extensibility and Future Development

The FERS-UI project's architectural choices are deliberately made to foster long-term extensibility and facilitate
future development. The component-based design, centralized data management, and reactive data flow create a flexible
foundation for growth.

## Adding New Simulation Element Types

The current architecture makes it straightforward to introduce new types of radar elements or entities into the
simulator:

* **Data Model Expansion:** Define the default properties and structure for the new element type within the central data
  store's default definitions.
* **Property Editor Creation:** Create a new specialized property editor component that extends the base property
  editor. This new component will define the UI controls for the new element's unique properties.
* **UI Integration:** Register the new property editor within the dynamic loading mechanism of the Property Inspector.
  Update the Scene Hierarchy to allow adding and displaying the new element type.
* **XML Integration:** Extend the XML import and export logic to correctly parse and generate the XML representation for
  the new element type, ensuring compatibility with the FERS core.
* **3D Visualization:** Implement the 3D visualization logic for the new element, allowing it to be represented and
  animated within the 3D world view based on its data.

This modular approach minimizes the impact on existing codebase, allowing for rapid iteration and expansion of supported
elements.

## Enhancing Visualization Features

The decoupled nature of the 3D visualization layer allows for significant enhancements without affecting the core data
management:

* **Advanced Trajectory Visualization:** Implement sophisticated rendering for platform and target trajectories,
  including historical paths, future predictions, or dynamic trails.
* **Sensor Coverage & Beam Patterns:** Visualize dynamic antenna patterns, beamwidths, and coverage areas in 3D,
  reacting to element positions and orientations.
* **Clutter and Environment Models:** Integrate visualization for environmental factors like terrain, buildings, and
  clutter models, potentially leveraging external data sources or procedural generation.
* **Simulation Data Overlays:** Display real-time simulation output data (e.g., received power, SNR, Doppler shift) as
  overlays or heatmaps in the 3D view.

## Deeper Integration with FERS C++ Core

While the current XML interchange is effective, opportunities for deeper integration exist:

* **Real-time Data Streaming:** Explore methods for real-time data streaming between the FERS C++ core and the UI,
  potentially using network protocols or shared memory, to enable live simulation visualization and interactive control.
* **GDExtension for Performance-Critical Features:** For computationally intensive tasks or direct interaction with FERS
  C++ libraries, GDExtension (Godot's C++ extension system) offers a path to integrate high-performance logic directly
  into the UI, without recompiling the engine. This could be used for custom physics, complex signal processing
  visualization, or direct control of the FERS simulation loop.
* **Bidirectional Control:** Extend the UI to not just configure and run simulations, but also provide live controls to
  pause, resume, or modify parameters during a running simulation (if supported by the FERS core).

## General UI Improvements

The current architecture facilitates continuous improvement of the user experience:

* **Undo/Redo System:** Implement a robust undo/redo system leveraging the centralized data store, as changes are
  funneled through a single point.
* **Scenario Management:** Develop features for saving, loading, and managing multiple simulation scenarios within the
  UI.
* **User Preferences:** Allow customization of UI layouts, visual themes, and simulation defaults.
* **Tooling for Asset Creation:** Build integrated tools for generating complex waveforms, defining target RCS patterns,
  or creating antenna patterns directly within the UI, reducing reliance on external files.

The modular and reactive design of FERS-UI provides a solid foundation for evolving into a comprehensive and powerful
radar simulation workbench.
